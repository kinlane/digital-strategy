title: Visualizing the Progress on the White House Digital Strategy
---

{% include JB/setup %}

<p>Now that I have found a way to <a href="/2013/01/18/developing-a-scorecard-rooted-in-core-of-the-digital-strategy/">score federal agencies in their participation</a> in the White House Digital Strategy, and <a href="/2013/01/19/pulling-the-data-needed-to-assess-progress-on-the-digital-strategy/">pulled the data</a> I needed to asses the progress, I can begin looking for ways to visualize this progress and the value coming from the work.</p>
<p>I'm working with an <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> partner <a href="http://concentricsky.com">Concentric Sky</a> to help quantify the progress of the top 10 or 20 federal agencies in the areas of social, data and mobile.</p>
<p>The next phase is to develop an infographic and potentially other, more interactive visualizations actually based upon APIs and open data developed by federal agencies.</p>
<p>Stay tuned, more to come!</p>
