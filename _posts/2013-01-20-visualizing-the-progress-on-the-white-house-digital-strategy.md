title: Visualizing the Progress on the White House Digital Strategy
---

{% include JB/setup %}

<p>Now that I have found a way to rank federal agencies in their participation in the White House Digital Strategy, and pulled the data I needed to asses the progress, I can begin looking for ways to visualize this progress and the value coming from the work.</p>
<p>I'm working with an API Evangelist partner Concentric Sky to help quantify the progress of the top 10 or 20 federal agencies in the areas of social, data and mobile.</p>
<p>The next phase is to develop an infographic and potentially other, more interactive visualizations actually based upon APIs and open data developed by federal agencies.</p>
<p>Stay tuned, more to come!</p>
