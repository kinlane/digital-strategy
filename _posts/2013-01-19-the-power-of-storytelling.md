title: The Power of Storytelling

{% include JB/setup %}

<p>The most important skill I've developed over the last two years, being the API evangelist has been storytelling.  The ability to tell stories in the API space has been the greatest asset to my career and hopefully added value to the industry.</p>
<p>In the early days of working on the web, the most common tool I have in my toolbox is the HTML page.  Over the years I've been able to enrich with CSS and JavaScript to make more impactful.</p>
<p>While content has always been king in everything I do online, data and data-driven web pages are has been a critical tool in deploying projects online.</p>
<p>After static pages and database driven pages, a blog has been an invaluable tool in my programmer and storyteller toolbox.  I have had a blog since 2005, and feel the format is a cornerstone of Hacker Storytelling.</p>
<p>Next up is presentations.  Event though this format is not my favorite, it is still essential in sharing ideas around many talks and one on one meetings.</p>
<p>I do a lot of reading, research and writing.  Rather than building sites that live on my server, I wanted to transform my work into smaller projects, that are open by default, entirely living and running on Github.</p>
<p>I will be telling the story of my projects, and evolve the tools I use to do it, here at Hacker Storytelling.</p>
