title: All Data is Machine Readable by Default

{% include JB/setup %}

<p>After pulling together the data needed to assess the progress on the White House Digital Strategy, I wanted it available in a single data store, so I could be used and shared to its fullest potential.</p>
<p>As part of the <a href="http://hackerstorytelling.com" taraget="_blank">hacker storytelling</a> process, I will be publishing a single JSON data store of all agencies who have published their strategy, have an active social presence on Facebook, Twiter and Github and have published 2.2 Data and 7.2 Mobile API iniatives as part of their digital strategy.</p>
<p>Periodically I will update the JSON file, as well as keep archive stores for historical purposes. I will use the central JSON store of top agencies to tell stories, while also providing for others to use and share.</p>
<p>Hopefully this demonstrates a format that can be used in aggregating, organizing data from multiple sources and making available for visualization and consumption by other projects.</p>
