---

{% include JB/setup %}

<p>In my 2.5 years of dedicated tracking on APIs, I've learned one thing--showcase the positive.  API Evangelist is built on showcasing innovative things, peopole around the globe are doing with APIs.</p>
<p>Now that we are through the 2012 election, and more than six months into the Whitehouse CIO's strategy, entitled "Digital Government: Building a 21st Century Platform to Better Serve the American People", providing federal agencies with a 12-month plan to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enabling more efficient and coordinated digital services delivery</li>
<li>Encouraging agencies to deliver information in new ways that fully utilize the power and potential of mobile and web-based technologies</li>
<li>Requiring agencies to establish central online resources for outside developers and to adopt new standards for making applicable Government information open and machine-readable by default</li>
<li>Requiring agencies to use web performance analytics and customer satisfaction measurement tools</li>
<p>I want to take a snapshot of where we are at. I just don't want to write, yet another blog post.  I wanted to provide this snapshot in a way that showcases the postive coming from the Digital Strategy, but in a way that shows the value of a healthy digital strategy, using best tools and approach I can.</p>
<p>I'm using my <a href="http://hackerstorytelling.com" target="_blank">hacker storytelling</a> process to tell the story of where we are at with the Whitehouse CIO's strategy in 2013.<p>
