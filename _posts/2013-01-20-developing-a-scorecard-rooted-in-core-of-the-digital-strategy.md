title: Developing a Scorecard That Was Rooted in the Digital Strategy
---

{% include JB/setup %}

<p>I wanted to showcase the positive in the Whitehouse Digital Strategy, using the tools prescribed in the strategy--such as social, open data, machine readable by default and open APIs.</p>
<p>To do this i needed to define, what was "positive" within the strategy.  In my opinon a healthy digital strategy is equal parts about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social</li>
<li>Open Data</li>
<li>Open APIs</li>
<li>Mobile</li>
</ul>
<p>Using these areas, I wanted to establish a ranking definition that would help me sort the 246 federal agencies, and showcase the top 10 or 20 that were doing the most meaningful work.</p>
<p>I developed the following definition:</p>
<ul>
<li>Digital Strategy - Have they published their digital strategy in HTML, JSON and XML</li>
<li>Social - Number of Twiter accounts, Twitter followers, Facebook accounts, Facebook likes, Github accounts and Github repositories</li>
<li>Data - Number of API iniatives around open data.</li>
<li>Mobile - Number of API Iniatives to support mobile efforts.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think once we start seeing more APIs and mobile apps deployed we'll be able to measure those areas a litle more critically, but for now this will do.</p>
<p>Now that I have a definition of what consititues "postive" behavior from federal agencies as part of the Digital Strategy, I can move to gather the data I need to rank agencies.</p>
